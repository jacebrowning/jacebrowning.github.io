title: About Me
---

I build, customize, and integrate tools that empower developers to deliver high-quality code. I have experience working on products in the embedded, mobile, and web domains, with a particular expertise in test automation, especially in Python. Professionally, I focus on Quality Assurance, CI/CD, and Developer Experience tooling. In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open source projects, volunteering at local technology events, and combining that with civic activism.
